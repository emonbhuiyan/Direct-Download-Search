## What Is It?

**The Directory Compass** is a simple yet powerful web utility designed to simplify the process of finding direct download links for files. Instead of relying on crowded, ad-filled download sites, this tool crafts precise, advanced search queries to locate publicly accessible files on open web directories.

Whether you're looking for open-source software, public domain ebooks, or free-to-use audio, this tool points you in the right direction.

## Features âœ¨

* **Intuitive Interface:** A clean, minimal design that gets straight to the point.
* **Pre-built Queries:** Select a file type (e.g., movies, music, books) and the tool will automatically format the most effective search query for you.
* **Example Suggestions:** The search bar provides real-time examples to help you understand how to phrase your query for the best results.

## How to Use It

1.  **Select a File Type:** Choose a category from the dropdown menu that best matches what you're looking for (e.g., `Music ðŸŽµ`).
2.  **Enter Your Query:** Type your search term into the bar. The example text will guide you on how to format it.
3.  **Click Search:** The tool will open a new browser tab with the search results, directly leading you to potential open directories.

## The Technical Details

This project is a single, self-contained HTML file. It uses basic JavaScript to dynamically build a Google search query based on user input and a predefined set of parameters. The magic lies in the `intitle:index.of` operator, which targets web pages that list files in a directory format. This, combined with filters for common file extensions and malicious websites, gives you a powerful and effective search.
